## How to add/update presentations (Videos/.ppt/.pdf, etc.)?
1. Power point presentations are hosted on [Slideshare]
2. Videos are hosted on box at [Test Armada Presentations]
3. All presentations copies are kept in box.
4. In box, there are two folders: [DXT Presentations] (SandBox) and [Test Armada Presentations] (Production for doc-site)
5. While you are working on any presentation you may use DXT Presentation folder to create, edit, share a presentation.
6. [Test Armada Presentations] is further divided into two folder `Internal: For Internal site only` and `External: For Internal and External site`
    > Internal is a `Superset` of external that is any presentation that is kept in external folder will also be available on internal site 
7. Once you are ready to share your presentation on doc-site, move/copy or update the presentation in [Test Armada Presentations] folder following the below steps:
    * Decide if your presentation is for internal site only or can be used for external site as well.
    * If for internal site only - copy the presentation to `internal` folder under appropriate sub-folder (General, S.S. Portal, Mocking, Functional, Performance, etc.)
    * If for internal and external both - copy the presentation to `external` folder under appropriate sub-folder (General, Mocking, Functional, Performance, etc.)
            
8. Add/update the presentation file in [Slideshare] using the credentials in the secrets repo under the `Slideshare` heading. Use following steps to add/update on slideshare:
    * Once logged in, there is a button in the upper right titled Upload. Click this and follow the instructions to upload the Power Point file. Make sure to add Tags to increase visibility of the presentation.
