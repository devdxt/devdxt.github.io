### What is native Android TDK?

The functional native Android Test Development Kit (TDK) enables you to execute your native Android tests easily, reliably and quickly in the cloud. By using [Flank](https://github.com/TestArmada/flank) which is part of the TDK, users can run their native Android tests in parallell on Firebase test lab in just a few steps.  The TDK will also provide a summarized diagram and logs for each test package and detailed XML test reports are shown in the job directly and also sent to our DI platform to track the results using the Test Armada dashboard.
