### **Summary**

The backend Performance testing that is part of the Performance Testing fleet of Test Armada is based on JMeter. This solution has been developed in-house and built entirely on open source components. It enables any developer to execute performance tests on their own and view the detailed test results real time on the self service portal. It allows engineers to develop and/or modify tests quickly and easily thereby saving the overall time taken to create and execute any type of performance tests.
