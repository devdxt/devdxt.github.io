## Introduction

The Self-Service Portal (S.S. Portal) is a UI tool enabling developers to setup and execute functional, frontend and backend performance test projects with a few clicks. The tool also provides data insights offering real-time and trending reports giving you the power to troubleshoot and debug issues on demand and monitor the health of your test suite.
